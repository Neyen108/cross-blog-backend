# CrossBlog ðŸ”€ Backend `(work-in-progress)`  
  
This repository houses a Docker-enabled-Nodejs/Typescript-MongoDB backend for a personal project of mine - `CrossBlog ðŸ”€`   

The project follows REST Principles and Folder structure, alongwith some basic Tests.  

# What is CrossBlog ðŸ”€   
CrossBlog ðŸ”€ is my personal Blog management system/dashboard.   
#### *CrossBlog ðŸ”€ is made to actualize the idea of - `write once, post everywhere`*   

Often times, bloggers/writers write blog posts on one platform. 
- They then promote the blog post as they usually would.      
- A few days or a week later, when traffic is dying down, they syndicate the post or crosspost on Medium, or Dev.to, or Hashnode.      

Anyone who has done it before can tell you, itâ€™s tedious and somewhat annoying to do. Part of the reason for this is - the respective blogging platforms donâ€™t make it easy to import robust content automatically. You have to go through and copy-and-paste everything, format it using their tools, and generally reconstruct the entire post every time.     

### Here is where CrossBlog ðŸ”€ comes to the rescue.    
`CrossBlog` provides a `Markdown` editor and previewer where I can write my blog posts using Markdown. Once I have written my post, I can save it on my database.   
If the post is done with all the editing, I can publish on multiple blogging platforms that support Markdown content (eg. Medium, Dev.to, Hashnode, etc) with just a few clicks.   
In order to publish on multiple platforms, I am making use of their APIs.

## CrossBlog functionalities
- create blog posts using Markdown and save them
- edit saved blog posts
- invite friends/collaborators to preview the posts
- allow previewers to comment, like on posts
- give editor level access to collaborators, proofreaders, etc.
- publish blog posts on multiple blogging platforms (Medium, Dev.to)   


# Quick Start Guide

To run the cloned codebase directly, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/download/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.
  1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
  2. Run `sudo docker-compose up -d` to get a MongoDB instance running.
  3. Make your own `.env` file in the project root, following the key name but not value used in `.env.example`.
  4. From there, any the following should work:
  
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run test-debug`
  - `npm start`
  - `npm run debug`
  
### For linux/mac users, replace the `scripts` of the `package.json` file with the following:  
  ```sh
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsc && node --unhandled-rejections=strict ./dist/app.js",
    "debug": "export DEBUG=* && npm start",
    "test": "mocha -r ts-node/register 'test/**/*.test.ts' --unhandled-rejections=strict",
    "test-debug": "export DEBUG=* && npm test"
  },
  ```
  
# To-do
  1. Add invite functionality. 
  2. Create separate databases for test and production cases.
  3. Write documentation for the APIs.
